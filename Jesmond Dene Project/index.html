        <h1>Our Animals</h1>
        <p>Jesmond Dene offers a wide range of wildlife and history to offer. Take a walk through the luscious forest and hear the calls of the wild birds or stroll down by the ouseburn river and catch a glimps of the otters. For the first time in living memory, wild otter cubs have been born in the dene. A great example of our efforts to restore biodiversity to Newcastles remaining natural landscapes. If searching for these animals isn't for you, then please join us at our visitor center and see the small zoo of friendly animals we have!
